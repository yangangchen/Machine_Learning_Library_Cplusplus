**Author: Yangang Chen. My Machine Learning Library in C++.**

**Contents:**

1. **Nonlinear Regressors**: Implementation of polynomial regressor and Gaussian process regressor, with k-fold cross validation.

2. **Nonlinear Classifiers (two classes)**: Implementation of logistic classifier (with polynomial basis) and Gaussian naive Bayes classifier, with k-fold cross validation.

**Requirements:**

To run the code, you need to install the C++ library **Eigen**:
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

Then execute:
```
$ make
$ ./myprogram
```
